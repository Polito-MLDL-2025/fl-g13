29/04 Questions for Riccardo
- Does it make sense to do a dropout also on frozen layers?
- Can we apply transformations on validation set?

15/04 Questions for Riccardo
- At "make centralized model" we need to make just a model as in labs, or rather pre-traing with some batches the server's model, which will then be shared with the rest of the network?
- Do we need to transform and augment our data? Then we tune using different optimizers. Can we use Adam?
- What is Dino? What are scores in the table? Can we use DinoV2?
- not seeing comments

### Notes
- Transformations to use:
	- Normalization
	- Random Crop
	- Horizontal Flip (no vert!) 
	- (Only normalization for Test)
- Try different batch_size
