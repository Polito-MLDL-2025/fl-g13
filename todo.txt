## Todo

- [X] Clean codebase
    X rename modeling/ultis in modeling/utlis
    X remove references, docs?
    X remove plots.py, features.py?
    X remove modeling/predict.py?
    X move dataset_handler.py to parent folder or modeling?
    X remove unused @app.commands (datasets.py)?
    X save data in the correct folder (as done in class)
    X provide versioning in requirements.txt for future use
    X auto install nbautoexports using requirements.txt
    X clean interfaces
    X rework codebase (e.g., why model and optimizers as parameters for load_or_create? Should split load_or_create in two distinc functions etc.)
    X rework README file
    X use of tensors in returns of test values, is it strictly necessary?
    X add comments
    X reorder parameters signature
    X resedisgn train save and load signatures
    X typing parameter in fl_g13 code
    [ ] plots of loss, stats and similar
        X lossi and acci (list of losses to plot later)
        - plot image maps of activations in neurons
        - plot saturations plots of activation layers
        - plot gradient to data ratios (should be among -2 and -3 in a log10 scale)\
