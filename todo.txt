## Todo

- [ ] Clean codebase
    X rename modeling/ultis in modeling/utlis
    X remove references, docs?
    X remove plots.py, features.py?
    X remove modeling/predict.py?
    X move dataset_handler.py to parent folder or modeling?
    X remove unused @app.commands (datasets.py)?
    X save data in the correct folder (as done in class)
    X provide versioning in requirements.txt for future use
    X auto install nbautoexports using requirements.txt
    X clean interfaces
    X rework codebase (e.g., why model and optimizers as parameters for load_or_create? Should split load_or_create in two distinc functions etc.)
    X rework README file
    X use of tensors in returns of test values, is it strictly necessary?
    - plots of loss, stats and similar (using wandb? or maybe by hand in the karpathy way)
    - add comments
    X reorder parameters signature
    X resedisgn train save and load signatures
    - data/raw -> data
